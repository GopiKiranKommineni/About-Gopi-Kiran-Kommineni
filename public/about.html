<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I'm Gopi Kiran Kommineni, a software developer with 4 years of experience
  in building web applications. I have a deep understanding of programming
  languages such as Python, Java C and C++, and have worked extensively with
  frameworks such as Flask,Fast API, Angular, ReactJS and Libraries like React.
</p>

<p>
  My experience includes working on a variety of projects, ranging from
  small-scale web applications to large, enterprise-level systems. I am
  comfortable working with both front-end and back-end technologies, and have a
  proven track record of delivering high-quality code on time and within budget.
</p>

<p>
  What I love most about software development is the opportunity to solve
  complex problems and create solutions that have a real impact on people's
  lives. I am constantly learning and exploring new technologies to improve my
  skills and keep up with the ever-changing landscape of web development.

<p>
  When I'm not coding, you can usually find me reading tech blogs, participating
  in online coding communities, or attending tech meetups and conferences. I'm
  also an avid runner and enjoy exploring new trails and parks in my free time.

  If you're looking for a talented and dedicated software developer to join your
  team, feel free to reach out to me. I'm always excited to collaborate on new
  projects and help create innovative solutions that make a difference.
